# Pose estimation using a sensor node network

A pipe-end pose estimating system made during my master's thesis "Pose Estimation of Drilling Pipe Using a 3D-Sensor Network".
In addition, the system uses Tiny-Yolov3 running on Jetson computers to detect the pipes: https://github.com/jenbu/Yolo_pipe_detector
